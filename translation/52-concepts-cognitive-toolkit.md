52 Concepts To Add To Your Cognitive Toolkit

> 升级心智工具包的52个概念

![](http://mcntyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cognitive_toolkit-300x164.png)

Concepts change the way we think. Before we knew about evolution, we couldn't explain much of what was going on around us; for example, how there came to be such a diversity of species on earth. We've collated a list of some concepts that have changed the way we think about the world that might be useful additions to your cognitive toolkit.

> 概念改变思维方式。在知道进化之前，我们无法解释大多周遭发生的现象；比如，为什么地球上的物种如此多样？我们整理了一些概念的列表，这些概念改变了我们的思维方式，也许能有效地补充你的心智工具包。

Not all of them are useful - in fact, you'll find some to be downright useless. People seem to be at different stages in their patterns of thinking: perhaps at your stage #7 will be too obvious or inapplicable, while #26 will be just the idea you need to help answer some problems you've been thinking about. We wrote this list because we're sure us-of-the-past would have appreciated such a list. We hope you do too. We're always on the hunt for concepts and the like - if any come to mind, please leave them in the comments.

> 并非所有列出的概念都是有用的。实际上，你会发觉有些完全没用。每个人的思维方式可能处于不同阶段，也许在你所处的阶段#7显得太直白或不适用，而#26这一概念正好能帮助你回答一直苦苦思考的问题。编写这份列表，是因为我们确认自己曾经非常需要它。我们希望你也能受益。我们将继续追寻类似的概念，如果你有什么想法，请留言。

There really is so much more to be said on most of these points than we have here. However, we've tried to keep things brief, simplifying where necessary, while providing lots of links for those who are interested in reading further. Looking at links will be of particularly high value for this post, as many of these concepts will seem obvious and scarcely worth saying when you simply read their definition. It's only in seeing their application and how that changes your thinking that you can realise their value.

> 对大多概念还有很多未尽之言。不过，我们试图保持简洁，尽量简化，同时提供大量链接，以供感兴趣的读者参考。阅读这些链接将对本文附加非常高的价值，因为如果你只是简单读一下定义，许多概念看上去显而易见，几乎不值一提。只有看到实例，及如何用概念改变你的思维，才能更好理解它们的价值。

1.Signalling/ countersignalling - the idea that an action conveys information to someone about the actor. Buying an expensive wedding ring conveys that you don't think you're about to run off immediately after the wedding (lest you lose three months of your salary). Countersignalling is when the information you're trying to signal is so obvious that you need not have signalled in the first place. For instance, Warren Buffett doesn't need to drive around in a Ferrari to signal how rich he is - everybody already knows that - and not driving around in a Ferrari differentiates him from the plebs that do need to drive one. Note: Buffett still lives in his house in Omaha that cost $31,000 back in 1958, despite being worth billions, but possibly for reasons other than countersignalling.

>  1.[信号/反信号](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countersignaling) - 行为向某人传达了该行动者的信息。购买昂贵的婚戒传达的信息是你不会认为自己在婚礼后会立刻逃跑（免得你损失三个月的工资）。反信号则是你想发出的信号非常明显，甚至完全不需要发出该信号。比如，沃伦巴菲特不需要坐着法拉利兜风来显示自己多富裕，这是尽人皆知的事实。而不坐着法拉利兜风，也不会将他跟需要开法拉利的大众分开。注：巴菲特还住在奥马哈的房子里，在1958年这房子就值31,000美元，而现在价值已经逾十亿，但这可能并非出于反信号的原因。

2.Nudge - the manner in which choices are presented to a target audience can have dramatic effects on their chosen action - even without changing the incentives which might typically motivate an individual to make a given choice. You can install News Feed Eradicator to decrease the likelihood of your future self spending all day scrolling through Facebook. The tax office can write letters saying that 90% of people who work the same job as you have completed their tax return already. Your electricity company can install an electricity meter which constantly reminds you how many watts you're chewing through at a given time. Male urinals are sometimes made with a small and shoddy picture of a housefly in the centre of them as a target to reduce, err, puddles.

> 2.[微调](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) - 将选项展示给目标受众的方式，会极大影响他们的行动，甚至不需要改变激励措施，而通常激励被用来激发个人积极性。你可以安装[杜绝订阅新闻的插件](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl%3Den)，来减少之后刷Facebook的时间。税务机关可以写信说，90%跟你同工种的人都完成了税务申报。你的电力公司可以安装电表，不停地提醒你在给定时间内使用了多少瓦数。男性便池有时在正中设置了一幅小而简陋的苍蝇图片，作为减少，嗯，飞溅的靶心。 

 3.Marginal thinking - what are extra resources worth? If you have no bananas, and you get a banana, it's probably worth more to you than if you already had one million bananas and you get an extra. This is an important concept because it might lead to the realisation that not all the bananas hold the same value to you. Slightly less trivially, what matters with your charitable donation is what happens with that donation, not the average of what the charity achieves. Extra donations to distribute bed nets could do more once there are already the distribution lines established, so it could achieve more. Conversely, it might be already distributing at capacity, and extra donations buy bed nets for $10 instead of $5. Fortunately, the Against Malaria Foundation will still be able to distribute bed nets at exceptional efficiencies, and is a great target for your festive givings.
 
 >3.[边际思维](http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/margins.html) - 额外资源有多少价值？如果你没有香蕉，然后得到一个香蕉，对你的价值可能多于你已经有一百万香蕉再给你一个。这概念很重要，因为可能有助于理解并非所有香蕉对你的价值都是均等的。再举个不常见的小例子，对你的慈善捐款更重要的是这笔捐款的用途，而不是慈善机构募集资金的平均数。额外捐款可能对蚊帐的分发有用，如果已经建成了分发渠道，就可以派送更多出去。相反，也可能已经达到最大配给额度，而额外捐款买了价值10元而不是5元的蚊帐。幸运的是，对抗疟疾基金会还在以超高效发送蚊帐，也是你假日捐款的[好对象](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf)。

 4.System 1 & System 2 thinking - when we're making decisions, we use two different systems. System 1 is fast and subconscious, often described as our 'gut feeling'. It has an edge in social situations or when time is a limiting factor. System 2 is slower and more methodical, better with models and numbers, and deliberate.

> 4.[系统1和系统2思维](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow%23Two_systems) - 我们做决策时使用两种不同的系统。系统1是快速、潜意识的，通常被形容为“直觉”。在社交场合或时间紧迫时占优势。系统2是慢速的、更有条理，更适用模型和数字，也是有意识运作的。

System 1 and System 2

> 系统1和系统2

 5.Comparative vs. absolute advantage - if you are better than me at earning an income from your job and cleaning the house, you have an absolute advantage in both these activities. Does that mean that both of us are better off if you do both? Not necessarily. Suppose you earn $100/hour at work, 10 times more than my $10/hour and further that you clean the house approximately twice as fast as I do. Of these two jobs, I'm 'least bad' at cleaning the house, so it might be (depending on the social costs that this arrangement incurs) that both of us would be better off if you paid me $25 an hour to clean your house. Generally, people should do the action that they're the least bad at, thus working to their comparative advantage.
 
 > 5.[相对与绝对优势](http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Details/comparativeadvantage.html) - 如果你工作赚得比我多，也更擅长打扫房子，你在两项活动中占据绝对优势。这是否意味着，如果两者都让你做，对我俩会更好？不一定。假如你工作每小时赚100美元，是我的时薪10美元的10倍。另外，你打扫房间的速度又是我的两倍。在这两份工作中，我在打扫房间上“最不坏”，所以根据安排带来的社会成本，如果你付我每小时25美元来打扫你的房间，可能对我俩会更好。人们一般做自己干起来“最不坏”的行动，从而发挥相对优势。

 6.Efficient market hypothesis - there are many people approximately as clever as you who value approximately the same things you do. It's unlikely you'll be walking down the street and stumble on $100 000 sitting on the ground which no one else has picked up. In the same way, it's unlikely you'll be able to choose a company on the stock market that will do 100 times better than the average company which no one else has already found and invested in (driving the cost of parts of the company (shares) up). This is the same reason why you might have a hard time finding a car park that is (i) free, (ii) right next to work, and (iii) somewhere you can park in all day. Even though such car parks do exist, over time word gets out, and they are occupied in the short term or monetised in the long term. Everything is a market. Thus, when taking the efficient market hypothesis into account, you should 1) look for the things you value in places that other people have systematically failed to look, and 2) think that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.  
 
> 6.[(有效市场假说](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) - 有许多人跟你一样聪明，价值取向也差不多。不大可能发生这种事，你走在大街上就能踩到地上躺着的一百万美元，而没人捡起来。同样，不大可能你能在股票市场上找到盈利率高达一般公司100倍的公司，而没人发现并投资（驱动公司的部分价格上涨，即股份）。基于同样的原因，你可能很难找到一个停车场同时是(1)免费的(2)就在工作地点边上(3)能停一整天。就算存在这样的停车场，久而久之消息传出去，要么很快会被塞满，要么总有一天会收费。[一切都是市场](http://marketsineverything.com/)。所以，采用有效市场假说，你应该1) 在其他人系统性思考无法触及的地方，寻找你看重的东西；2) 有些事情看上去太好，不像真的，那多半就不是真的。

 7.Illusion of transparency - we tend to overestimate how much our mental state is known by others, a fact not helped by the ambiguity of the English language. "Elizabeth Newton created a simple test that she regarded as an illustration of the phenomenon. She would tap out a well-known song, such as "Happy Birthday" or the national anthem, with her finger and have the test subject guess the song. People usually estimate that the song will be guessed correctly in about 50 percent of the tests, but only 3 percent pick the correct song. The tapper can hear every note and the lyrics in his or her head; however, the observer, with no access to what the tapper is thinking, only hears a rhythmic tapping." - Wiki. This phenomenon applies equally well to explanations of novel concepts and the interpretation of emotional states.

> 7.[透明度假象](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency) - 我们往往高估了自己的心理状态为他人所知的程度，英语的模糊性也无法改善这一事实。“伊莉萨白·牛顿创建了一个简单的测试，认为可以说明这一现象。她会用手指敲出一首知名的歌曲，比如“生日快乐”或国歌，让测试对象猜歌名。通常人们估计能有一半被试者猜对，但实际只有3%选对了正确的歌曲。敲歌的人能在他或她的脑海中听到每个音符和歌词，但观测者无法知道敲歌人的想法，只能听出敲击的节奏。” - 引自[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency)。这一现象也适用于对新概念的解释和情感状态的说明。 

 8.Opportunity cost - when we choose to take one option, we are implicitly not taking another. If you only have enough room for one meal and your favourite is the Pad Thai, you choose it. But this means you can't also get the Massaman curry (your second favourite). Economists call this your opportunity cost - your choice minus the benefits of the next best alternative. Opportunity costs are everywhere and form a critical part of decision making. If you're not donating to the very best charity, you're not helping others as much as possible. Furthermore, if you don't spend your time in the best way possible, that is coming at a cost.
    
>8.[机会成本](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) - 我们做一项选择时，也就默认放弃了另一项选择。如果你只吃得下一顿饭，你又喜欢泰式炒河粉，你会选择它。但这意味着没法同时享用马沙文咖喱，你第二喜欢的食物。经济学家称此为机会成本-你的选择减去从第二最佳选项带来的好处。机会成本无处不在，是决策的重要成分。如果你没有捐款给最好的慈善机构，你就没有最大化地帮助别人。此外，如果你没有花费时间在最重要的事上，也会产生机会成本。

 9.Cognitive biases - these are systematic flaws in how we think. We don't look for information that proves us wrong. We estimate that events we can easily recall (perhaps because they happened more recently, or frequently appear in the media) are more likely to occur than they are. We're overconfident. Particularly relative to our level of expertise. And a whole bunch more. The plot thickens: it's only our friends and colleagues who are biased. (Author's caution: don't become fallacy (wo)man).

> 9.[认知偏差](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) - 我们思考过程中的系统性错误。[我们不会去找证明自己错误的信息](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Wason.27s_research_on_hypothesis-testing)。[我们估计](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)自己更容易记得的事情会更多发生，也许只是因为这些事最近发生，或经常被媒体报道。[我们会过于自信](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect)，尤其是对[与专业技能相关的事](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)，或[更多其他事情](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)。令情况更复杂的是这种想法：只有[朋友和同事](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot)才有偏见。（作者提示：别成为[跳坑人](http://existentialcomics.com/comic/9)）。

 10.Heuristics - we use rules of thumb to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty (which turns out to be almost every single decision we make). This is both a blessing and a curse. It's quicker, useful when we don't have much information we could deal with explicitly. But also by its nature requires us to make generalisations that might not turn out to be true. It pays to notice that we are using them because they can be wrong.

 > 10.[启发思维](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision-making) - 用经验法则在不确定的情况下做决定，我们独立做出的几乎所有决策都是这样。这既是祝福，也是诅咒。当没有明确可供处理的信息时，这方法更快、更有效。但实际上，这使我们推演出不一定真实的规则。因为启发思维可能会导致错误，意识到我们正在使用它是有意义的。
    
 11.Counterfactual reasoning - what might have happened otherwise? You could push the paramedic out of the way and do the CPR yourself, but you'll likely do a worse job. So even if you stop the patient from dying, your (counterfactual) impact is likely small, if not negative. Doctors wanting to make a big difference will do more good if they travel to a developing country where their patients might not have received quality healthcare if not for them. 
    
 > 11.[反事实推理](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/counterfactuals/) - 反过来会发生什么？你可以推开医护人员，自己做心肺复苏，但可能做得很糟。就算你拯救了病人，就算不是反效果，这个反事实所起的作用也可能很小。如果[医生](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/top-careers/profiles/medical-careers/)去发展中国家，那里的病人可能没有受过或没资格接受高质量的医疗，这些想[大有作为](https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/)的医生会做得更好。
    
 12.Bayesian reasoning - assigning a probability before an event, receiving evidence, and updating the probability you assigned. This is beneficial insofar as it forces us to think probabilistically. Moreover, it allows us to account for competing evidence and promotes a nuanced view, thus avoiding a simplistic black and white application of 'good and bad' outcomes.

> 12.[贝叶斯推理](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK7X_XlGB8) - 在事件发生前设置初始概率，接收证据信息，再更新之前设置的概率。只要能让你[用概率思考](https://yourbrainonecon.wordpress.com/tag/probabilistic-thinking/)，这就是有意义的。而且，这能让我们思考互斥的证据，促使我们细致观察，从而避免对“好与坏”结果非黑即白地简单应用。 

![](http://mcntyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image09-300x192.png)

Bayes' Theorem

> 贝叶斯定理

 13.Expected value - the probability of each outcome multiplied by the value of each outcome. For example, a 50% chance of winning $100 is worth $50 to you, and you should be willing to invest up to $50 for a chance to win (but no more). Applied example: If you have two mutually exclusive ways of helping people, should you take the 10% chance of helping 1 billion people, or the 90% chance at helping 1 million (an equal amount as the billion, and holding all else equal)? Without using expected value, this is a nearly impossible question to evaluate.
    
> 13.[预期值](https://www.cardschat.com/poker-odds-expected-value.php) - 每个结果的概率乘以相应的价值。比如，有二分之一的机会赢得100美元意味着价值50美元，你最多愿意投入50美元去争取胜算，但不是更多钱。实例：如果你有两种互斥的方法来助人，你会以10%的几率帮助十亿人，还是以90%的几率帮助一百万人（等量于十亿，而其他都一样）？不用预期值，这个问题几乎无法解答。

 14.Time value of money -we'd prefer to have $100 today than tomorrow, or in a year's time. In a real sense, this implies that money today is worth more than money in the future. This preference comes from the opportunities we have to invest it at (say) 5% interest and gain $5 in that year. How much less you'd be willing to receive now than in a year, is the discount rate (which is 5% in this example).

> 14.[金钱的时间价值](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) - 我们更愿意今天就获得100美元，而不是明天或明年。实际上，这暗示今天的金钱比以后的更值钱。这一偏好来自于我们有可能以比如5%的利率投资这笔钱，一年就能增加5美元。现在获取的钱比明年能获取的少多少，是我们愿意现在拿钱的底线呢？这取决于[贴现率](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp)，在这个例子里是5%。

15.Prisoner's dilemma/ Tragedy of the commons - a problem in game theory that explains a lot of real world problems. In this situation, there are two players choosing between cooperating and not cooperating. You both do well if you both cooperate. But if you don't cooperate while the other player tries to cooperate, you do even better. If both of you don't cooperate then neither of you do well. But if you're the chump who tries to cooperate while the other player doesn't, you get screwed worst of all. Examples of this include countries individually benefitting economically from not limiting their carbon emissions, to everyone's detriment; athletes using performance enhancing drugs to be more individually competitive, when all athletes would be worse off if everyone did it; everyone in society benefits from paying taxes to get roads, but each citizen would rather have the road and not pay taxes herself; etc..Prisoner's Dilemma

> 15.[囚徒困境](https://www.quora.com/Game-Theory/What-is-the-prisoners-dilemma-in-laymans-terms)/[公地悲剧](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) - 博弈论中的一个问题，可用于解释大量[实际问题](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-real-world-example-of-the-prisoner-s-dilemma-in-recent-history)。该情况下，两个游戏者选择合作还是竞争。如果两人都选择合作，对大家都有好处。但如果你不合作，而对方试图合作，情况对你更有利。如果两人都不合作，那么对大家都没好处。但如果你是试图合作的笨蛋，而对方不愿合作，那你的情况就不能更糟了。这种例子包括：不限制碳排放的国家自己获取经济利益，但最终损害所有人的利益；使用兴奋剂的运动员更有竞争力，但如果每个人都这样做，那对大家都没好处；社会上人们缴税来修建道路，但每个人宁愿坐享道路而不用自己赋税；等等…

16.Revealed preferences - talk is cheap, and our actions reveal more about our preferences than we'd like to believe. For instance, although I might say that Marmite is my favourite spread to put on toast, I actually buy Vegemite (#justaustralianthings). As such, my actions reveal what I really prefer. In another example, while Tesla might survey thousands of Australians, of which 60% say they'd pay extra for a greener car, when the car actually becomes available, only 10% follow through with their purchase.

> 16.[显示偏好](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference) - 空话无益，行动比一厢情愿的认识更能揭示我们的喜好。比如，尽管我会说最喜欢在吐司上放酸酯酵母，但实际上买了咸味酱 (参考#justaustralianthings)。如此，行动表明什么才是真爱。再举一个例子，特斯拉公司大约调查了数以千计澳大利亚人，其中60%说他们会花更多钱买环保汽车，但汽车真上市时，只有10%的人真的买了。

17.Typical mind fallacy - the mistaken belief that others are having the same mental experiences that we are. As the links show, the differences go surprisingly far. Detailed questionnaires have shown that when some people 'see' a zebra in their mind's eye, they're simply recalling the idea of a zebra, whilst others can count the stripes!

> 17.[典型心理](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/)[陷阱](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) - 错误地认为其他人也和我们有相同心理体验。如链接内容所示，人们之间差异很大。详实问卷表明，要求在脑海中“看见”一匹斑马时，有些人只是简单回顾斑马的概念，而另一些人则能数斑马的条纹！

18.The value of your time - You could use your time to earn more money, or do something else that you value. Even if driving to the other side of town saves you $10 on groceries, if it takes you an extra hour, you're implicitly valuing your free time at $10 per hour. This might be a good deal if you only earn $6 an hour with the company you started after seeing the story of "This One Single Mom Makes $1000 Per Hour - Google HATES Her". On the other hand if your friend Grace can convert her free time into $50 an hour at work, then for her driving the extra hour is a poor use of time. What's more, if both Grace and yourself are volunteering alongside each other in a soup kitchen when you'd be happy to work there for $10 an hour, Grace should consider working instead, donating the money she earns, and employing 5 people like you to run the kitchen per hour she is at work.

> 18.[你的时间价值](http://www.clearerthinking.org/#!value-of-your-time-calculator/c15t0) - 你可以用时间赚更多钱，或做其他认为值得做的事。如果开车到小镇另一头买杂货能节省10美元，但要多花一个小时，暗示你的自由时间值10美元1小时。如果你看了“单亲母亲一小时赚1000美元 - 谷歌恨她”的故事后，自己开了个创业公司，每小时只能赚6美元，那么绕路买东西可能是个不错的选择。但如果你朋友格蕾丝能把她的剩余时间转换成工作，每小时挣50美元，那么多开一个小时的车对她而言就太浪费了。而且，如果格蕾丝和你一起志愿参加流动厨房，你会很高兴每小时能挣10美元，而格蕾丝会考虑工作，把赚的钱捐出来，她工作的一个小时可以雇佣5个像你这样的人施粥。

19.Fundamental attribution error - attributing others' actions to their personality, but your actions to your situation. You see someone kick the vending machine and assume it must be because they are an angry person. But when you kick the vending machine, it's because you were hot and thirsty, your boss is an asshole, and the vending machine stole your last goddam dollar.

> 19.[基本归因错误](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) - 将别人的错误归结于个性问题，而将自己的错误归结于环境因素。看到有人踢自动售货机，你会觉得他们易怒。而自己踢自动售货机，是因为你又热又渴，你的老板是混蛋，而自动售货机私吞了你仅剩的几块钱。

20. Aumann's agreement theorem - if two rational agents disagree when they both have exactly the same information, one of them must be wrong. The 'same information' qualifier is crucial; very often disagreement is due to differences in information, not failure of rationality. So you should take disagreement seriously if you have reason to believe the other person has significant information that you don't.

> 20. [奥曼一致理论](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem) - 如果两个理性的人基于一模一样的信息得出不同看法，其中一个人肯定搞错了。“一样的信息”是个关键条件，通常不一致的看法来自不一致的信息源，而不是推理的错误。所以，如果你有理由相信对方知道你所不知的关键信息，就应该重视对方的看法。

21.Bikeshedding - substituting a hard and important problem for an easy and inconsequential one. When designing a nuclear plant, Parkinson observed that the committee dedicated a disproportionate amount of time to designing the bikeshed - which materials should it be made of, where should it be located etc. These are the kind of questions that everyone is clever enough to contribute to, and where everyone likely wants to have their opinions heard. Unfortunately, these might be discussed at the cost of some of crucial detail, like how to prevent the power plant from killing everyone. image05

> 21.[打口水仗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality) - 用简单又无关紧要的问题取代困难而重要的问题。在设计核电站时，帕金森注意到委员会浪费了大量时间来打口水仗，比如要用什么材料，位于什么地方等等。每个人都能回答这些问题，也希望别人能听到自己的回答。不幸的是，一些关键细节的讨论时间可能因此缩减，如怎样防止电站泄露杀死所有人。

22.Meme - the social equivalent of a gene, except instead of encoding proteins, they represent rituals, behaviours, and ideas. They self-replicate (when they're passed from one person to another), mutate, and some are selected for in a population - these are the ones that get transmitted. Like selfish genes, the most useful memes don't necessarily get reproduced. Rather, it is those that are most likely to have a trait that is selected for. Memes are interesting because of the predictions they allow you to make. For instance, there should be few major social movements in society that don't have the meme "find (or create) other like-minded people to join the movement".

> 22.[模因](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) - 基因的社会性等价物，不编码蛋白，而代表习俗、行为和思想。它们也能自我复制（可以在人群中传播）、突变，有些被特定人群选中，即传播。跟[自私的基因](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene)一样，最有用的模因不一定传播最广。反而是那些外部特征最容易被选择的。模因很有趣，能帮助你预测结果，例如，假设没有“找到（或创造）类似思想的人来参加活动”这个模因，社会上几乎不会存在大规模社交活动。

![](http://mcntyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image11-300x283.png)

Dawkin invented the meme

> 道金斯创造了模因这个词

23.Algernon's Law - IQ is nearly impossible to improve in healthy people without tradeoffs. If we could get smarter by a simple mechanism, like upregulating acetylcholine, which had no negative side effects (in the ancestral environment), then perhaps evolution would have upregulated acetylcholine already. We could equate this with the 'efficient market hypothesis' of improving brain function.

> 23.[阿尔杰农定律](http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics) - 如没有利益交换，健康人群的智商将很难提高。如果我们能通过简单机制变得更聪明，比如提升乙酰胆碱水平，而没有任何副作用（在原始环境下），那么进化机制可能早就会升高乙酰胆碱水平了。可以将此等同于提升大脑性能的“有效市场假设”。

24.Social intuitionism - moral judgements are made predominantly on the basis of intuition, which is followed by rationalisation. For example, slavery was previously a social norm and thought to be acceptable. When asked a question ("is slavery good?"), proponents of slavery introspected an answer ("yes"), and confabulated a reason ("because they're not actually human" or similar atrocious falsehoods). As this example shows, blind faith in our intuitions can be harmful and counterproductive, because they can be easily corrupted by immoral social norms. It wasn't just that proponents of slavery got the wrong answer: they had - and we still have -  the wrong process.

> 24.[社会直觉](http://lesswrong.com/lw/10f/the_terrible_horrible_no_good_very_bad_truth/) - 直觉通常是主导道德判断的基础，之后再被合理化。比如，奴隶制本来是社会常规，被大众接受。当被问（“奴隶制好吗？”）时，赞成奴隶制的人会反思这个回答（“是”），再虚构理由（“因为他们不是人”或类似的恶劣谎言）。这个例子说明，[盲信直觉可能有害](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/20/the-baby-in-the-well)或事与愿违，因为直觉可能被败坏的社会规范腐蚀。奴隶制的支持者不仅回答错误，他们的思考过程也是错误的，而我们的思考过程也是如此。

25.Apophenia - the natural tendency of humans to see patterns in random noise. E.g. hearing satanic messages when playing songs in reverse.

> 25.[模式妄想](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) - 人们自然倾向在随机噪声中看到模式，如[倒放磁带听歌时会听到邪恶的声音](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking%23Satanic_backmasking)。

26.Goodhart's law/ Campbell's law - what gets measured, gets managed (and then fails to be a good measure of what it was originally intended for). If we use GDP as a measure of prosperity of a nation, and there are incentives to show that prosperity is increasing, then nations could 'hack' this metric. In turn, this may raise GDP while failing to improve the living conditions in the country.

> 26.[古德哈特定律](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)/ [坎贝尔定律](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law) - 被衡量的东西被管制（所以无法成为好的度量指标，来实现原本意图）。如果用GDP作为国家繁荣的指数，许多刺激可以显示该指数增加，那[国家就可以“破解”这个指标](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/drugs-prostitutes-add-to-italy-gdp-2014-10?r%3DUS%26IR%3DT)。反过来，这可能提高GDP，但无益于提升该国的生活水平。

27.Moral licensing - doing less good after you feel like you've done some good. After donating to charity in the morning, we're less likely to hold the door open for someone in the afternoon. 

> 27.[道德牌](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing) - 当你觉得自己做了点好事，你就会做些不大好的事。早上捐款给慈善机构，下午就不大会替别人拉开门。

28.Chesterton's fence - if you don't see a purpose for a fence, don't pull it down, lest you be run over by an angry bull which was behind a tree. If you can't see the purpose of a social norm, like whether there is any value to having family unit, you shouldn't ignore it without having thought hard about why it is there.  Asking people who endorse the family unit why it's important and noticing their reasoning is flawed often isn't good enough either. 

> 28.[切斯特顿的栅栏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence) - 如果看不出栅栏的价值，也不要拆掉，以免被树后愤怒的公牛撞倒。如果看不出设置社会规范的目的，比如家庭单位是否有存在价值，在苦苦思索答案前，不该对此规范视而不见。询问支持家庭单位的人，为什么会认为它很重要，注意他们推理的漏洞，仅仅这样做[还不够好](https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/mistakes-3-breaking-chestertons-fence-in-the-presence-of-bull/)。

29.Peltzman effect - taking more risks when you feel more safe. When seatbelts were first introduced, motorists actually drove faster and closer to the car in front of them.

> 29.[佩兹曼效应](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation) - 当感觉更安全的时候，你更想冒险。刚开始引入安全带时，摩托车手实际上开得更快，更接近前方的汽车。

30.Semmelweis reflex - not evaluating evidence on the basis of its merits and instead rejecting it because it contradicts existing norms, beliefs and paradigms. Similar to the status quo bias (which one might choose to combat with the reversal test).

> 30.[塞梅尔魏斯反射](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semmelweis_reflex) - 不根据优点评估证据，反而因为它与现有规范、信仰、范式抵触就拒绝它。与[现状偏见](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias)类似，人们可能会选择与[逆向实验](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_test)对抗。

31.Bateman's principle - the most sexually selective sex will be that which has the most costs from rearing the offspring. In humans, women have more costs associated with raising offspring (maternal mortality, breastfeeding, rearing) and are the more selective sex. In seahorses, the opposite is true: male seahorses carry the offspring in their pouch, and are more selective with those they choose to mate with.

> 31.[贝特曼原理](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%27s_principle) - 性选择权最强的性别会花费最多精力在养育后代上。人类中，女性会花费更多精力养育后代，表现在产妇死亡率、哺乳、养育上，女性也是有更多选择权的性别。海马则相反：雄海马把后代装入育儿袋，选择配偶时也有更多选择权。

32.Hawthorne effect - people react differently when they know they are being observed.

> 32.[霍桑效应](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect) - 如果知道自己正在被观看，人们会表现得与平时不同。

33.Bulverism - dismissing a claim on the basis of how the opponent got there, rather than a reasoned rebuttal. For example, "but you're just biased!" or "of course you'd believe that, you're scared of the alternative."

> 33.[布佛氏论证](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism) - 基于对手推理的过程，直接驳回其论点，而不是合理的反驳。比如，“你就是有偏见！”或者“你害怕其他选择，当然会这样认为。”

34.Flynn effect -IQ has increased by 3 points per decade since around the 1930s. It is hotly debated why this is happening, and whether the trend will continue.

> 34.[弗林效应](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) - 自从20世纪30年代以来，IQ每十年会增长3点。为什么会发生这一现象、这一趋势是否会持续下去，还在激烈争论中。

35.Schelling point - a natural point that people will converge upon independently. For instance, if you and I have to meet in Sydney on a particular day, and we don't know when or where, we might go to where we normally meet, or fall back on meeting at the Opera House at 12PM. This is an important effect in situations where coordination is essential but explicit discussion is difficult.  Furthermore, participants may not even realise it's happening. For example, "I don't want to live in a society where genetic enhancement of children increases the gap between the rich and poor. Unfortunately, there's no clear place at which to say 'wait, we're about to reach that society now, let's stop enhancement!' Perhaps my comrades and I should instead object against any genetic manipulation at all, including selecting for embryos without cystic fibrosis (even if we wouldn't mind that particular selection occurring)."

> 35.[谢林点](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_\(game_theory\)) - 人们会自然而独立地汇聚成一个论点。比如，如果你和我某天要在悉尼见面，而不知道时间和地点，我们可能会去通常聚会的地方，或者转而中午12点在悉尼歌剧院碰头。当必须协调而又难以明确讨论时，这种效应非常重要。何况参加者可能还不知道事件发生了。比如，“我不想住在这样的社区，对孩子的基因强化扩大了这里的贫富差异。不幸的是，我们没法明确什么场合下才能说‘等等，这个社会就要实现了，别再强化基因了！’也许我和同事应该反对任何形式的基因操作，包括选择没有囊性纤维化的胚胎，就算我们并不介意这种特定选择。”

36.Local vs global optima - see the carefully crafted image by yours truly below. In short, you might need to make things worse in order to get to a global optimum - the best possible place to be. If you want to earn more, you might have to sacrifice the number of hours you can work in the short term in order to take a course which will allow you to increase your income in the future.

> 36.[局部最优](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_optimum)对[全局最优](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimum) - 请看下面这幅精心绘制的图片。总之，为达到全局最优点，也就是所有情况下最好的点，你也许要把事情弄糟。如果想赚更多钱，你得牺牲近期投入在工作上的时间，参加会增加你未来收入的课程。

![](http://mcntyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image07-300x238.png)

Local vs. Global Optima. We can often get stuck in a local optimum - it's a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.

> 局部最优对全局最优。结果通常会停留在局部最优，在探索与开发之间取得权衡。

37.Anthropic principle - you are given a sleeping pill which will wake you up twice if heads, and once if tails. You wake up. What is the chance that today is the day you wake up twice? Similarly, what is the chance that we're in one of the only universes that is capable of supporting life?

> 37.[人择原理](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle) - [给你一片安眠药](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem)，如果硬币投出正面会唤醒你两次，而投出负面会唤醒你一次。你醒来了。有多大几率今天你会醒两次？同样，有多大几率我们的宇宙是[唯一](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse)有生命存在的宇宙？

38.Arbitrage - taking advantage of different prices between markets for the same products.

> 38.[套利](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) - 利用同一产品在不同市场上价格不同来牟利。

39.Chaos theory - "Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."

> 39.[混沌理论](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) - “混沌：现在决定未来，但大致相同的现在并不近似地决定相同的将来。”

![混沌钟摆](http://mcntyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image03.gif)

A double rod pendulum animation showing chaotic behaviour. Starting the pendulum from a slightly different initial condition would result in a completely different trajectory.

> 双杆钟摆的动画展示了混沌行为。从稍微不同的初始条件开始钟摆，会形成完全不同的轨迹。

40.Ingroup and outgroup psychology - this doesn't just explain phenomena like xenophobia, but also the left-right political divide. Our circle of concern is probably expanding over time.

> 40.[群内与群外心理学](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/) - 可以解释现象，如仇外、左右派别的政治鸿沟。我们关注的圈子[可能随时间而扩展](http://www.amazon.com/The-Expanding-Circle-Evolution-Progress/dp/0691150699)。

41.Red Queen hypothesis - organisms need to be constantly evolving to keep up with the offenses and defenses of their predators and prey, respectively. This is probably the effect we should thank for the existence of sex.

> 41.[红皇后假说](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) - 生物需要持续进化，分别用来对付天敌的攻击和猎物的防御。这一效果可能应该归功于[性别的存在](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis%23The_paradox_of_sex:_The_.22cost.22_of_males)。

42.Schelling's segregation - even when groups only have a mild preference to be around others with a similar characteristic - say, a preference for playing baseball - neighbourhoods will segregate on this basis.

> 42.[谢林隔离](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/) - 即使群体只有轻微的偏好，喜欢接近相似特性的其他群体，比如爱好玩棒球，也会在此基础上分隔出社区。

43.Pareto improvement - a change that makes at least one person better off, without making anyone worse off.  

> 43.[帕累托改进](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) - 变化使至少一个人过得更好，而不会使其他人过得更糟。

44.Occam's razor/ law of parsimony - among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

> 44.[奥卡姆剃刀/简约法则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) - 在不同假设中，挑选预设最少的那条。 

45.Regression toward the mean - if you get an extreme result (in a normal distribution) once, additional results are likely to be closer to the average selection. If one trial suggests that health supplement x is amazingly better than all the others, you shouldn't put all your faith in that result.
    
> 45.[向均值回归](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) - 如果有一次（在[正态分布](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)中）得到了极端结果，更多的结果可能倾向于接近平均的选择值。如果只有一次试验表明保健品x比其他的好太多，你不应完全相信这个结论。

46.Cognitive dissonance - holding two conflicting beliefs causes us to feel slightly uncomfortable, and to reject (at least) one of them. For instance, holding the belief that science is a useful way to discover the truth would conflict with another belief that vaccines cause autism. In you held both of these beliefs, one would have to be discarded.

> 46.[认知失调](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) - 同时持有两个冲突的信念，会使我们觉得不大舒服，从而拒绝（至少）其中一个。比如，认为科学是发现真相的有效途径，可能与疫苗导致自闭症这一信念相冲突。如果你同时认为两者皆对，至少有一点需要被否定。
    
47.Coefficient of determination - how well a model fits or explains data (i.e. how much of the variance it explains).
    
> 47.[判定系数](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) - 一个模型能多好地吻合或解释数据（即能解释多少误差）。

48.Godwin's Law - as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1. At this point, all hope of meaningful conversation is lost, and the discussion must stop.

> 48.[高德温法则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_Law) - 当在线讨论时间变长，讨论涉及到比较纳粹或希特勒的可能性逼近1。此时，已经完全失去有益会话的希望，讨论应当停止。

![高德温法则](http://mcntyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image08-300x240.png)

49.Commitment and consistency - if people commit to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honour the commitment if establishing that idea or goal is consistent with their self-image. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed after they have agreed, they will continue to honour the agreement. For example, once someone has committed themselves to a viewpoint in an argument, rarely do they change 'sides'.

> 49.[承诺与一致](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini%23Six_key_principles_of_influence) - 如果承诺完成一个想法或目标，而认为这个目标与自我形象一致，会更容易履行承诺。即使在协议后原激励或动机已被消除，也会继续履行协议。比如，一旦某人在争论中采取了某一观点，就很难改变“立场”。

50.Affective forecasting - predicting how happy you will be in the future contingent upon some event or change is hard. We normally guess that the magnitude of the effect will be larger than it actually is, because 1) we've just been asked to think about that event, which makes it seem more important than it actually is in our everyday happiness, and 2) we underestimate our ability to adapt.
    
> 50.[情感预测](http://mcntyr.com/4-common-prediction-failures-and-how-to-fix-them/) - 很难预测你未来会多幸福，这取决于一些事件或变动。我们通常会高估影响的程度，因为1）[刚要求我们考虑这一事件，使它显得比在实际日常生活中更重要](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring%23Focusing_effect)；2）会低估自己的适应能力。

51.Fermi calculation (aka 'back of the envelope calculation') - involves using a few guesses or known numbers to come to an educated guess about some value of interest. To illustrate, one could approximately calculate the number of piano tuners in Chicago by plugging a few estimates like population, percentage of houses with a piano, and piano tuner productivity into a calculation.
    
> 51.[费米估算](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem)（又名“信封底计算”） - 用少量猜测或已知的数字，得到对一些有趣值的可靠猜测。比如，可以通过采样少量估值，如人口、有钢琴的房子数、钢琴调音师的效率，来近似算出[芝加哥钢琴调音师的数目](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem%23Examples)。

52.Fermi's paradox - is the problem we confront when we run a Fermi calculation on the number of habitable planets in our galaxy and realise how weird it is that we seem to be alone. It leads to some interesting conclusions.

> 52.[费米悖论](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html) - 用费米估算计算宇宙中可居住行星的数目时，会遇到这个问题，真奇怪，地球似乎是唯一生命行星。这导致一些[有趣的结论](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox%23Hypothetical_explanations_for_the_paradox)。
